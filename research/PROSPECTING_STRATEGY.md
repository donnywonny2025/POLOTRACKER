**Company:** Deep State Media | deepstatemedia.io  
**Service:** Political Video Production  
**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Status:** Research Phase

---

## The Strategy (Summary)

1. **Source prospects** from OpenSecrets (biggest political ad spenders — Super PACs, campaigns, party committees)
2. **Rank by spend** — start with the biggest budgets, work down the list
3. **Reverse-engineer contacts** — find the decision-makers (media buyers, campaign managers, PAC directors)
4. **Categorize by party** — Republican vs Democrat
5. **Send personalized outreach** — each email links to a party-specific landing page:
   - Republicans → `deepstatemedia.io/r` (shows Republican campaign work samples)
   - Democrats → `deepstatemedia.io/d` (shows Democrat campaign work samples)
6. **Track responses, follow up, repeat** — work down the list from biggest to smallest

## Outreach Strategy

### Step 1: Find Contacts

For each prospect, reverse-engineer the decision-makers:

| Role | Where to Find |
|------|--------------|
| **PAC Director / Executive Director** | FEC filings (fec.gov), organization website, LinkedIn |
| **Media Buyer / Ad Buyer** | LinkedIn search "[Org Name] media buyer", look for firms like GMMB, Targeted Victory, etc. |
| **Campaign Manager** | FEC filings, press releases, LinkedIn |
| **Communications Director** | Organization website, LinkedIn |
| **Treasurer** | FEC filings (listed on every filing) |
| **Digital Director** | LinkedIn, organization website |

**Pro tip:** FEC filings at https://www.fec.gov/data/ list the **treasurer** and **contact info** for every registered committee. That's public record.

### Step 2: Build the Spreadsheet

Columns for the prospecting spreadsheet:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Organization | PAC / Committee name |
| Lean | R / D / Bipartisan |
| 2024 Spend | Total outside spending |
| 2022 Spend | Historical spending (shows consistency) |
| Tier | 1 (Whale) / 2 (Major) / 3 (Mid) |
| Contact Name | Decision-maker name |
| Title | Their role |
| Email | Contact email |
| LinkedIn | Profile URL |
| Status | Not contacted / Emailed / Responded / Meeting / Closed |
| Link Sent | Which landing page URL was sent |
| Notes | Any intel |

### Step 3: Party-Specific Landing Pages

Build two versions of the Deep State Media portfolio page:

| URL | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| `deepstatemedia.io/r` | Republican-leaning work samples, red accent elements, conservative messaging examples |
| `deepstatemedia.io/d` | Democrat-leaning work samples, blue accent elements, progressive messaging examples |
| `deepstatemedia.io` | Main site — neutral, shows range across both parties |

**Implementation idea:** Could be as simple as `?party=r` or `?party=d` query params that swap portfolio cards and color accents via JavaScript. One codebase, two presentations.

### Step 4: Email Template (Draft)

```
Subject: [Org Name] — Video Production Inquiry

[Contact Name],

I'm reaching out from Deep State Media — we're a political video production 
company that specializes in [campaign ads / opposition research content / 
digital strategy video] for [Republican / Democratic] campaigns and committees.

We've produced work for [X races] across [Y states], and we noticed 
[Org Name]'s significant investment in [digital / broadcast / outside spending] 
this cycle.

I'd love to show you what we can do. Here's a quick look at our recent work:
→ deepstatemedia.io/[r or d]

If you're evaluating video production partners for the upcoming cycle, 
I'd welcome a 15-minute call to discuss how we can support your efforts.

Best,
[Name]
Deep State Media
deepstatemedia.io
```

### Step 5: Prioritization

Work the list in this order:
1. **Tier 1 ($100M+)** — 10 organizations, biggest budgets
2. **Tier 2 ($25M–$100M)** — ~22 organizations, substantial budgets
3. **Tier 3 ($10M–$25M)** — Dozens more, still significant
4. **Single-candidate Super PACs** — These often need dedicated video teams
5. **State-level PACs** — Smaller but recurring, less competition

---

## Key Insights

- **Top 5 Super PACs spent $1.4 BILLION** in 2024 alone
- **Video is the #1 line item** for most of these orgs (TV ads + digital video)
- **Both sides spend roughly equally** — don't limit to one party
- **Cycle timing matters** — reach out 12-18 months before election day for max budget availability
- **Recurring clients:** Organizations like Senate Leadership Fund, Congressional Leadership Fund, and Senate Majority PAC spend $200M+ *every cycle* — these are annuity accounts
- **New money:** Crypto PACs (Fairshake, Protect Progress) emerged in 2024 with huge budgets and are likely underserved by established political media firms
- **FEC filings are public** — treasurer name, committee address, and contact info are all searchable at fec.gov
