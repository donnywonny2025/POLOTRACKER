## The Big Picture

**69 statewide ballot measures** certified for the ballot in 32 states as of Feb 18, 2026.

**Key categories for DSM:**
- **Abortion/Reproductive Rights** — HIGH spending, emotional messaging, TV ads
- **Marijuana/Cannabis Legalization** — Moderate spending, younger demographics, digital + TV
- **Voting Rights/Democracy** — Lower spending, grassroots-focused

**Why Ballot Measures Matter:**
- Separate campaigns with their own budgets
- Need video for TV ads, digital ads, testimonials
- Often run by advocacy organizations (not campaigns), so different decision-makers
- Can be VERY well-funded (especially abortion rights measures)

## 🔥 ABORTION/REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BALLOT MEASURES

### States with Certified or Likely Measures

#### 1. **NEVADA — Question 6 (CERTIFIED)**

**Status:** ON THE BALLOT November 2026  
**Type:** Constitutional amendment (second vote required)  
**Position:** PRO-CHOICE (recognizes fundamental right to abortion)  
**Background:** Passed first vote in 2024, needs second affirmative vote to become constitutional amendment

**Current Law:** Abortion legal until 24 weeks (1990s ballot measure)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Second vote = final approval** → high-stakes campaign
- Nevada is a **swing state** → national attention and money
- Planned Parenthood is involved (challenging parental notification law)
- Republican governor has vetoed reproductive rights bills → amendment would override

**Video Needs:**
- TV ads emphasizing "finish what we started"
- Testimonials from Nevada women
- Messaging about protecting existing rights
- Countering anti-abortion messaging

**Campaign Organization:** Need to research who's leading the Yes on 6 campaign

**Opportunity:** CONFIRMED ballot measure = campaign is definitely happening

---

#### 2. **VIRGINIA (CERTIFIED)**

**Status:** ON THE BALLOT November 2026  
**Type:** Constitutional amendment  
**Position:** PRO-CHOICE (protects "the right to make and effectuate one's own decisions about all matters related to one's pregnancy")  
**Background:** Legislature approved twice (required process), guaranteed to be on ballot

**Current Law:** Abortion broadly available until week 26

**Why This Matters:**
- Virginia is a **swing state** → competitive, high-spending campaign
- Virginia is a **destination state** for Southern abortion seekers → preserving access is critical
- Protects against future legislative changes

**Video Needs:**
- TV ads emphasizing Virginia as a "safe haven" for reproductive rights
- Testimonials from Virginia women and out-of-state patients
- Messaging about protecting rights against future restrictions
- Swing-state messaging (appeal to moderates)

**Campaign Organization:** Need to research who's leading the Yes campaign

**Opportunity:** CONFIRMED ballot measure = campaign is definitely happening

---

#### 3. **IDAHO — Reproductive Freedom and Privacy Act Initiative**

**Status:** SIGNATURE GATHERING (50,000 of 71,000 signatures collected as of Nov 2025)  
**Deadline:** May 1, 2026 to submit signatures  
**Type:** Statutory right (not constitutional amendment)  
**Position:** PRO-CHOICE (legalizes abortion until viability)  
**Background:** Idaho currently has one of the nation's STRICTEST abortion bans

**Current Law:** Near-total abortion ban with felony punishment for providers

**Why This Matters:**
- **HUGE change** if it passes → going from near-total ban to legal until viability
- **High-stakes, emotional campaign** → lots of video needs
- 63% oppose felony punishment for providers (2024 poll) → public support exists
- National attention (Idaho is a test case for overturning strict bans)

**Video Needs:**
- **LOTS** of TV ads (this will be a major fight)
- Testimonials from Idaho women harmed by the ban
- Medical professionals explaining the impact
- Countering anti-abortion messaging
- Emotional, personal storytelling

**Campaign Organization:** **Idahoans United for Women and Families** (leading the campaign)

**Opportunity:** If signatures are submitted by May 1 and certified, this will be one of the BIGGEST ballot measure campaigns of 2026

**Next Steps:** Monitor signature submission, reach out to Idahoans United if measure qualifies

---

#### 4. **OREGON — Equality Amendment**

**Status:** SIGNATURE GATHERING  
**Type:** Constitutional amendment  
**Position:** PRO-CHOICE + LGBTQ+ RIGHTS (protects abortion, contraception, same-sex marriage, gender-affirming care)  
**Background:** Oregon already has strong protections, this would enshrine them in constitution

**Current Law:** Strong abortion and LGBTQ+ protections already in place

**Why This Matters:**
- **Defensive measure** → protecting existing rights
- Broad coalition (reproductive rights + LGBTQ+ rights)
- Sends a message in a blue state

**Video Needs:**
- Less urgent than Idaho/Missouri (Oregon is solidly blue)
- May have lower budget (defensive, not offensive)
- Coalition messaging (reproductive rights + LGBTQ+ rights)

**Opportunity:** Lower priority than Idaho, Nevada, Virginia, Missouri

---

#### 5. **MISSOURI — Amendment 3 (ANTI-ABORTION)**

**Status:** CERTIFIED (legislatively referred)  
**Type:** Constitutional amendment  
**Position:** ANTI-CHOICE (would REPEAL 2024 pro-choice amendment and ban abortion from conception)  
**Background:** Missouri voters approved pro-choice amendment in 2024, but Republican legislature is trying to overturn it

**Current Law:** 2024 amendment recognizes reproductive rights, but implementation has been blocked by AG

**Why This Matters:**
- **HUGE FIGHT** → this will be one of the most expensive ballot measure campaigns in 2026
- Missouri is a **cautionary tale** → even after winning, pro-choice side is fighting to implement
- National implications (can voters' will be overturned by legislature?)

**Video Needs:**
- **BOTH SIDES** will spend heavily on TV ads
- DSM is Democrat-focused, so we'd work with the **NO on Amendment 3** campaign (defending the 2024 pro-choice amendment)
- Messaging about "respecting voters' decision"
- Testimonials from Missouri women
- Countering anti-abortion messaging

**Campaign Organization:** Need to research who's leading the NO campaign (likely Planned Parenthood, ACLU, etc.)

**Opportunity:** **TOP PRIORITY** — this will be a MASSIVE, high-spending campaign

## 🗳️ VOTING RIGHTS/DEMOCRACY BALLOT MEASURES

**Status:** Less information available, need to research further

**Why This Matters:**
- Voting rights measures typically have **lower budgets** than abortion or cannabis
- More grassroots-focused, less TV advertising
- But still need video for digital ads, testimonials, explainer content

**Opportunity:** **LOWER PRIORITY** for DSM (smaller budgets, less TV advertising)

5. **Defined timeline** (campaigns ramp up in summer, peak in fall)

### The Pitch to Ballot Measure Campaigns
