**Total Jobs:** 245 active postings  
**Video Editor Search Results:** 1 result (not directly video editing, but digital/comms with video component)

### Key Finding

**Limited direct "video editor" postings** on GAIN Power. The search for "video editor" returned only 1 result:

#### Digital Organizing & Communications Director — Seed the Vote
- **Location:** Oakland, CA (Remote)
- **Salary:** $90,000 - $120,000/year
- **Duration:** Limited term through Jan 30, 2027

- **Key Responsibilities:** 
  - "Guide the creative direction for graphics, video, and other digital content"
  - Manage contractors, designers, videographers
  - Oversee digital organizing and communications strategy
- **Not a direct video editing role** — this is a senior leadership/strategy position that manages video production

### Observations

1. **Job titles vary widely** — "video editor" may not be the standard search term
2. **Video work is often embedded** in broader digital/comms roles
3. **Many campaigns hire "Content Creators"** or "Digital Associates" who do video
4. **Need to search alternative terms:**
   - "video producer"
   - "content creator"
   - "digital producer"
   - "media producer"
   - "creative producer"

## Next Steps

1. **Search LinkedIn** for more specific video editor/producer postings
2. **Check Indeed** for political video jobs
3. **Search alternative terms** on GAIN Power:
   - "video producer"
   - "content creator"
   - "media producer"
4. **Research the campaigns that ARE hiring** — they may need video vendors even if not posting video positions
5. **Contact campaigns directly** — many don't post video vendor needs publicly

---

## Strategic Insight

**Most campaigns don't post "video editor wanted" jobs.** They either:
1. **Hire through agencies** (GMMB, BPI, SKDK)
2. **Use existing vendor relationships** (referrals)
3. **Hire freelancers directly** (via personal networks, not job boards)
4. **Post broader "digital" roles** that include video

**This means:** Job boards are just ONE data source. We need to:
- **Monitor campaign launches** (new campaigns = new vendor opportunities)
- **Track media director hires** (new media directors = potential new vendor relationships)
- **Research media buying agencies** (they control most video work)
- **Use LinkedIn** (more video-specific postings than GAIN Power)
- **Direct outreach** (most video work comes from relationships, not job postings)
