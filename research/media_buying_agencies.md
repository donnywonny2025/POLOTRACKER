# Media Buying Agencies — The Gatekeepers of Political Video Work

**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Source:** OpenSecrets analysis of 2024 cycle spending  
**Key Insight:** Political ad buying is HIGHLY CONCENTRATED — a handful of firms control billions in spending

---

## The Big Picture

**Total spending by top 5 vendors in 2024:** $2.1 BILLION  
**All five specialize in:** Media buying (ad placement, not production)  
**Key dynamic:** These firms are **intermediaries** between campaigns/PACs and media outlets — they control WHEN, WHERE, and HOW OFTEN ads run

**What this means for DSM:** Media buying agencies are the **gatekeepers**. They don't produce ads themselves, but they hire the production vendors who do. Getting on their vendor lists = access to massive budgets.

## TOP DEMOCRAT MEDIA BUYING AGENCIES

### 1. Waterfront Strategies + GMMB (The 800-Pound Gorilla)

**2024 Spending:** $858 million (by far the largest)  
**Parent Company:** GMMB (Democratic consulting powerhouse founded 1983)  
**Key Clients (2024):**
- Future Forward USA ($383M — 50% of Waterfront's total)
- WinSenate PAC
- House Majority PAC
- **90% of revenue from just 3 clients**

**Key People:**
- **Jim Margolis** — Partner at GMMB, media adviser to Obama (2008, 2012), Hillary (2016), Kamala Harris (2020)
- **Frank Greer** — Co-founder, lead media consultant for Bill Clinton (1992)

**Growth:** $92M (2012) → $858M (2024) = 9x growth in 12 years  
**Dominance:** Top or #2 vendor in EVERY cycle since 2014

**What This Means for DSM:**
- **This is THE major player** for Democrat political video
- They work with the BIGGEST PACs (Future Forward, House Majority PAC, WinSenate)
- They have deep connections to presidential campaigns and party leadership
- **Getting on their vendor list = access to hundreds of millions in ad spending**

**How to Approach:**
- Research GMMB's vendor application process
- Find out who manages their video production vendor relationships
- Position DSM as **overflow capacity** or **specialized rapid-response partner**
- Emphasize experience (Obama '08) and speed (rapid turnaround)

### 2. Media Buying & Analytics

**2024 Spending:** $339 million  
**Key Client:** Kamala Harris presidential campaign (vast majority of revenue)  
**Affiliation:** Democrat-aligned

**What This Means for DSM:**
- Second-largest Democrat media buyer
- Works directly with presidential campaigns (not just PACs)
- Less diversified than Waterfront (heavily dependent on one client)

**Opportunity:** May need vendor support for future presidential or major statewide campaigns

---

### 3. Gambit Strategies

**2024 Spending:** $208 million  
**Affiliation:** Democrat-aligned

**What This Means for DSM:**
- Third-largest Democrat media buyer
- Less information available, need to research further
- Still a major player with $200M+ in spending

---

### 4. Bully Pulpit Interactive (BPI)

**2024 Spending:** $186 million  
**Affiliation:** Democrat-aligned  
**Recent News:** Acquired Propper Daley (culture-first impact agency) in March 2025

**What This Means for DSM:**
- Major Democrat media buyer
- Expanding through acquisitions = growing capacity needs
- May need more vendor support as they scale

### 5. Screen Strategies Media

**2024 Spending:** $146 million  
**Affiliation:** Democrat-aligned

**What This Means for DSM:**
- Fifth-largest Democrat media buyer
- Need to research further

---

## TOP REPUBLICAN MEDIA BUYING AGENCIES (For Context)

### 1. Del Ray Media (Smart Media Group)

**2024 Spending:** $336 million  
**Key Client:** Make America Great Again Inc. (98% of revenue)  
**Affiliation:** GOP-aligned

**Note:** DSM is focusing on Democrat clients for 2026, so Republican agencies are lower priority. But good to know the landscape.

### 2. Strategic Media Services

**2024 Spending:** $289 million  
**Key Client:** Trump campaign ($270M)

### 3. Main Street Media Group

**2024 Spending:** $280 million

### 4. Flexpoint Media

**2024 Spending:** $270 million

---

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR DSM

### 1. Democrat Spending is HIGHLY CENTRALIZED

**Waterfront Strategies alone** handled $858M in 2024 — more than DOUBLE the second-largest Democrat vendor. This means:
- **One firm controls access to the biggest Democrat budgets**
- Getting on Waterfront/GMMB's vendor list = game-changer for DSM
- But also means there's **less competition** — if you're in, you're IN

### 2. Media Buyers Don't Produce Ads — They Hire Vendors

From the article:
> "Even though these media buying firms do not primarily produce campaign advertisements or control messaging, some political scientists say they exert significant power by acting as intermediaries..."

**What this means:**
- GMMB/Waterfront doesn't have in-house editors cutting 30-second TV spots
- They work with **production vendors** (like DSM) to create the ads
- Then they place those ads on TV, digital, radio, etc.

**DSM's play:** Get on their vendor list as a **production partner**

### 3. The "Incestuous" Network

From the article (quoting Prof. Mike Franz):
> "A lot of this is kind of incestuous – they work for the party and then they go to the consulting firm, or they work for the firm and then they go to the super PAC..."

**What this means:**
- Political media is a **relationship business**
- The same people cycle between campaigns, PACs, and agencies
- **Connections matter more than cold pitches**
- Need to find someone who can introduce DSM to GMMB/Waterfront

### 4. Super PACs Are Where the Money Is

**Future Forward USA** alone paid Waterfront $383M in 2024. Other major clients:
- **House Majority PAC** — supports House Democrats
- **WinSenate PAC** — supports Senate Democrats

**DSM's opportunity:**
- Super PACs have HUGE budgets
- They're "independent" but work closely with campaigns
- They need HIGH-VOLUME video content (negative ads, rapid response, etc.)
- Perfect fit for DSM's scrappy, fast-turnaround model

2. **Identify key contacts** — who manages production vendor relationships?

## THE PITCH TO MEDIA BUYING AGENCIES

### Version 1: Overflow Capacity

> "We're a political video production shop specializing in rapid-turnaround 30-second TV ads. We've been cutting spots since the Obama '08 campaign, and we know 2026 is going to be one of the busiest cycles in history. We're not trying to replace your existing production partners — we just want to be in your rotation when you need overflow capacity or a quick turnaround. Let us prove ourselves with a trial project."

### Version 2: Specialized Partner

> "We're a political video production shop that specializes in one thing: rapid-response 30-second TV ads. When news breaks and you need an ad cut and delivered in 24-48 hours, that's where we shine. We've been in the trenches since Obama '08, and we know how to move fast without sacrificing quality. We'd love to be your go-to vendor for rapid response and overflow work."

### Version 3: Geographic Advantage

> "We're a political video production shop with a team spread across key battleground states — including Michigan, where we have a videographer on the ground. With the Michigan Senate and Governor races both being open seats in 2026, we're positioned to provide local production support and rapid turnaround for Midwest campaigns. We've been cutting political spots since Obama '08, and we'd love to be a regional partner for your 2026 campaigns."

---

## BOTTOM LINE

4. Get on vendor list for 1-2 agencies
5. Deliver exceptional work
6. Expand relationships
7. Become a preferred vendor by 2028

**The key:** Relationships matter more than cold pitches. Find warm introductions if possible. If not, lead with proof of work (reel, case studies) and emphasize speed + experience.

## GMMB VENDOR APPLICATION PROCESS

**URL:** https://www.gmmb.com/mbe-teaming/

### Key Finding

GMMB has a **formal vendor application form** for "MBE Teaming" (Minority Business Enterprise partnerships).

**Form Requirements:**
- Name, Title, Company
- Address, Phone, Email, Website
- **Company Type** (checkboxes include):
  - ✅ **Video production services** (THIS IS US!)
  - Audio production services
  - Creative Services
  - Advertising
  - Media Planning and Buying
  - Photographer
  - Other categories

**Important Restriction:**
- Form requires certification: *"By checking the box, I certify that my company meets the requirements of a small, disadvantaged business as set forth by the Small Business Administration."*

### What This Means for DSM

**PROBLEM:** This form is specifically for **MBE/SBA-certified disadvantaged businesses**. DSM may not qualify unless:
- You're a minority-owned business
- You're a woman-owned business
- You're a veteran-owned business
- You meet other SBA disadvantaged business criteria

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Check if you qualify** — Are you, Dan, or any team members in a category that qualifies for MBE/SBA certification?

2. **Look for alternative contact methods** — This form is for MBE teaming, but GMMB likely has OTHER vendor relationships that don't require MBE certification. Need to find:
   - General vendor contact
   - Production services contact
   - Business development contact

3. **Partner with an MBE** — If you don't qualify, you could partner with an MBE-certified firm and apply jointly

4. **Direct outreach** — Skip the form, reach out directly to GMMB staff via LinkedIn or email

### Next Steps

1. **Research GMMB staff on LinkedIn** — find Production Manager, Vendor Relations, or Business Development contacts
2. **Check other GMMB pages** — look for general "Work with Us" or "Partnerships" pages
3. **Determine MBE eligibility** — check if DSM qualifies for any SBA certifications
4. **Prepare alternative pitch** — if MBE form doesn't apply, need direct outreach strategy

---

## ALTERNATIVE VENDOR CONTACT STRATEGIES

Since GMMB's public form is MBE-specific, here are other ways to get on their vendor list:

### Strategy 1: LinkedIn Outreach

**Target Roles:**
- Production Manager
- Creative Director
- Vendor Relations Manager
- Business Development Director
- Media Buying Manager

**Message Template:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm reaching out because Deep State Media specializes in rapid-turnaround political video production (30-second TV spots). We've been cutting spots since the Obama '08 campaign, and we're building our vendor relationships for the 2026 cycle. I'd love to learn more about GMMB's production needs and see if there's an opportunity to collaborate. Would you be open to a brief conversation?"

### Strategy 2: Warm Introduction

**Find connections:**
- Does anyone in your network know someone at GMMB?
- Do you have mutual connections with GMMB staff on LinkedIn?
- Have you worked with anyone who's worked with GMMB?

**Warm intro is 10x more effective than cold outreach**

### Strategy 3: Industry Events

**Attend political media conferences:**
- Campaigns & Elections Conference
- American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC) events
- State-level political events

**GMMB staff will be there** — opportunity for face-to-face networking

### Strategy 4: Prove Value First

**Work with smaller agencies/campaigns first:**
- Build case studies and testimonials
- Create a strong reel of 2026 work
- Get referrals from satisfied clients
- **Then** approach GMMB with proof of work

**GMMB is more likely to work with vendors who have recent, relevant work**

---

## OTHER AGENCIES TO RESEARCH

Since GMMB's MBE form may not apply, let's research vendor processes for other major agencies:

### To Research:

1. **Media Buying & Analytics** — find vendor application process
2. **BPI (Bully Pulpit Interactive)** — find vendor application process
3. **Gambit Strategies** — find vendor application process
4. **Screen Strategies Media** — find vendor application process
5. **Authentic** (mentioned in search results) — find vendor application process

**Action:** Search each agency's website for "Vendors," "Partners," "Work with Us," or "Careers" pages

---

## REALITY CHECK

**Getting on GMMB's vendor list is hard.** They're the biggest player, they have established relationships, and they're selective about who they work with.

**Better strategy for DSM:**

1. **Start with campaigns directly** — Michigan Senate/Governor races
2. **Build case studies** from 2026 work
3. **Get testimonials** from satisfied clients
4. **Then approach agencies** with proof of work

**Don't wait for GMMB to say yes.** Go get clients NOW, build your reputation, and THEN the agencies will come to you.

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ **Focus on Michigan campaigns** — Stevens, McMorrow, El-Sayed (Senate); Governor candidates
2. ✅ **Focus on Steyer campaign** — they're hiring video NOW
3. ✅ **Focus on Ossoff campaign** — offer overflow support
4. ✅ **Build relationships** with campaign staff
5. ✅ **Create case studies** from any 2026 work you land
6. ⏸️ **Revisit GMMB** in 6-12 months with proof of 2026 success

**Bottom line:** Agencies are important, but campaigns are the immediate opportunity. Get clients first, then leverage that success to get on agency vendor lists.
