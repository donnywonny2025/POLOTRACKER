## The Moment: February 2026 Political Climate

Before you pick up the phone, you need to understand what's happening RIGHT NOW. This is the landscape that's driving every dollar of political spending this cycle.

### Trump at 36% — Worst of His Second Term

Trump's approval is cratering. AP-NORC has him at **36% approval, 62% disapproval** (Feb 5-8, 2026). Pew has him at 37%. Even Rasmussen (usually friendliest to him) shows 47/51 underwater. His net approval on RealClearPolitics and Silver Bulletin is at second-term lows.

**What this means for DSM:** Anti-Trump energy is the #1 driver of Democratic ad spending. Every campaign, PAC, and issue org on the left is going to pour money into video this cycle because they smell blood. Midterms historically punish the president's party, and right now the math looks like 2018 all over again (when Dems flipped 40 House seats).

### DOGE Backlash Is the Ad Issue of 2026

Elon Musk's DOGE slashed federal agencies throughout 2025 — USAID gutted, Education Department restructured, mass federal layoffs. Musk stepped back in May 2025 but DOGE is chartered through July 2026. The fallout is everywhere:
- Federal workers protesting outside HHS, Treasury, Labor
- Unions filing lawsuits
- Democrats building an entire messaging apparatus around "Republicans cut your services"
- DOGE just open-sourced a Medicaid dataset in Feb 2026 — Dems framing it as invasion of privacy

**What this means for DSM:** DOGE is going to be in every other Democratic ad this cycle. "They cut your healthcare." "They fired the people protecting your food safety." "They gave your data to billionaires." This is visceral, emotional content — exactly the kind of video production you do. Every candidate in a competitive race needs ads about DOGE cuts. That's 50-80 House races, 10+ Senate races, and every battleground governor race.

### Democrats Lead the Generic Ballot by 7 Points

Economist/YouGov shows Democrats with their **largest generic ballot lead of the cycle**: D+7. Pew reports 82% of Americans want their leaders to push back against Trump. Individual Dem candidates are outraising their GOP opponents in key races (Ossoff already has $43M for GA).

**But** the DNC itself is broke — starting 2026 $3.5M in debt while the RNC has $95M in cash. MAGA Inc has $300M+ on hand. Trump's total war chest is $1.4-1.5 billion.

**What this means for DSM:** The money isn't at party committees — it's at **Super PACs, issue orgs, and individual campaigns**. Democratic candidates are self-funding and grassroots-funding at historic levels. Republican campaigns have massive PAC backing. Both sides need video. Don't pick a side in your outreach — work both.

### The Hot-Button Issues Driving Ad Money

These are the issues that will generate the most video production work in 2026:

| Issue | Who's Spending | Ad Tone |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **DOGE / Government Cuts** | Dem campaigns, unions, AFSCME, SEIU | Emotional: "They cut your [X]" |
| **Abortion / Reproductive Rights** | PP Action, EMILY's List, ballot measure campaigns | Personal stories, urgent |
| **Immigration / ICE Raids** | Both sides (opposite messages) | Fear-based, documentary-style |
| **Economy / Tariffs / Inflation** | Both sides | Kitchen-table, real-people testimonials |
| **Democracy / January 6 / Authoritarianism** | Dem PACs, Lincoln Project types | Alarm, patriotism, dark |
| **Anti-Trans / Culture War** | GOP PACs, Heritage Action | Provocative, shock value |
| **Medicare / Social Security / Medicaid** | AARP, Dem campaigns, unions | Senior-focused, personal |
| **Climate / Energy** | LCV, Everytown, API (both sides) | Depends on audience |
| **Crypto / Tech Regulation** | Fairshake, Protect Progress | Modern, aspirational |
| **Marijuana Legalization** | Ballot measure campaigns (FL, AZ, etc.) | Liberty, criminal justice reform |

### Resistance Movement = Spending Surge

Progressive groups are mobilizing hard:
- **Center for American Progress Action Fund** has a formal "Resist" campaign against Trump's agenda
- **Movement Voter Project** focused on flipping the House in 2026
- **Bend the Arc** raising for "Jewish fight to beat back fascism in 2026"
- **DNC** reported $7.4M in January grassroots fundraising alone
- **Ossoff** ($43M raised), **AOC** ($23M raised) — individual Dems are raising enormous amounts

All of these groups need **video content**. Ads, social clips, fundraising videos, rally content, documentary-style pieces. They are spending NOW.

### The DSM Angle: What You Sell in This Climate

You're not just selling "we make pretty videos." You're selling:

> **"We make the kind of video that wins in a high-stakes, high-emotion political environment. We've been doing this since '08. We know how to turn a 30-second spot around in 24 hours when news breaks. We know how to make someone feel something in their gut. We know how to make the DOGE cuts real, the immigration raids visceral, the abortion stories personal. We're not a corporate agency — we're operators."**

That's the energy. That's what separates you from Studio Center or some generic production house.

Your OpenSecrets research covers **Super PACs** — the most visible spenders. But PACs are only one slice of who buys political video. Here's the full ecosystem:

| Category | Volume | Ease of Entry | $ Per Project |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 1. Media Buying Agencies | ★★★★★ | Hard — relationships | Huge (they batch) |
| 2. Candidate Campaigns (Senate/House/Gov) | ★★★★ | Medium — direct outreach | $50K–$500K |
| 3. State Party Committees | ★★★ | Easier — less competition | $20K–$100K |
| 4. Super PACs / IEs | ★★★★★ | Hard — established vendors | $100K–$5M+ |
| 5. Issue Advocacy Orgs (501c4s) | ★★★★ | Medium | $50K–$500K |
| 6. Labor Unions | ★★★★ | Medium — relationships | $100K–$1M+ |
| 7. Ballot Measure Campaigns | ★★★★ | Medium — new each cycle | $1M–$100M+ |
| 8. Trade Associations & Industry Groups | ★★★ | Easier — year-round | $25K–$200K |
| 9. Lobbying / Public Affairs Firms | ★★★ | Easier — always need video | $10K–$100K |
| 10. Political Consulting Firms | ★★★★ | Medium — be their go-to | Referral-based |

**The #1 thing to understand:** Most political video work flows through **media buying agencies**, not directly from PACs. The PAC hires the agency. The agency hires you. Getting on 2-3 agency vendor lists = steady pipeline all cycle.

---

## CATEGORY 1: Media Buying Agencies ★★★★★ (THE GATEKEEPERS)

This is where the real money flows. These firms place billions in political ads every cycle. They need video production partners. If you get on their vendor list, you're getting work.

### Democrat-Side Agencies

| Firm | Clients | Why They Matter |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **GMMB** | Future Forward, SMP, HMP, DCCC, DSCC | Dominant Dem media buyer. They ARE the gatekeeper for the biggest PACs. |
| **SKDK** | Major Dem candidates, Biden 2020 | Full-service. Josh Isay runs it. Big DC presence. |
| **Bully Pulpit Interactive (BPI)** | Obama, Clinton, major Dem orgs | Digital-first. Obama's digital team started here. |
| **Precision Strategies** | Dem campaigns, progressive orgs | In-house video + creative team, but also outsource. |
| **270 Strategies** | Progressive campaigns/orgs | Obama-era operatives. |
| **AKPD Message and Media** | Dem candidates | David Axelrod's firm. Makes ads and buys media. |
| **Buying Time** | Dem Senate/House candidates | Major broadcast TV buyer. |
| **Canal Partners Media** | Dem candidates | Media buying specialists. |
| **Storefront Political Media** | Dem candidates | In-house production + media buying. |
| **Global Strategy Group** | Dem candidates, labor | Research + media. |
| **BerlinRosen** | Progressive orgs, unions | NYC-based, growing DC presence. |
| **New Deal Strategies** | Dem candidates | Smaller, scrappier — easier to get in. |

### Republican-Side Agencies

| Firm | Clients | Why They Matter |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Targeted Victory** | RNC, major GOP campaigns | Biggest GOP digital firm. Digital-first. |
| **National Media** | Senate Leadership Fund, CLF | Major GOP broadcast buyer. |
| **Smart Media Group** | GOP candidates | Media buying + production. |

| **American Media & Advocacy Group (AMAG)** | GOP PACs | Media buying specialists. |

### Bipartisan

| Firm | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Purple Strategies** | Public affairs, corporate advocacy |
| **Studio Center** | 50+ years. Audio/video production for political. 24/7 studio. |
| **Campaign Media Strategies** | Media buying + placement for both sides |

### How to Approach Agencies

**The pitch is different than pitching a PAC.** You're not selling them on hiring you for one campaign — you're selling them on adding you to their vendor roster as a reliable production partner.

**What they care about:**
- Can you turn around a 30-second spot in 48 hours? 24 hours?
- Do you have broadcast-quality equipment and post-production?
- Can you shoot in multiple states on short notice?
- Are you reliable, no drama, just deliver?
- Are your rates competitive?

**Call script concept:**
> "Hey, I'm [name] from Deep State Media. We're a political video production shop — been doing this since '08, just launched our own agency. We handle campaign ads, rapid response, opposition content — the full playbook. We're looking to be a production resource for shops like yours this cycle. Can I send you our reel?"

## CATEGORY 2: Candidate Campaigns — The 2026 Map

It's a midterm year. Here's where the money will be:

### 2026 Senate Races — Competitive Seats (Biggest Video Budgets)

**Democrat-Held Seats Under Threat:**

| State | Senator | Status | Budget Potential |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Georgia** | Jon Ossoff | Up for reelection — VERY vulnerable | $$$$ (50-state race) |
| **Michigan** | OPEN (Gary Peters retiring) | Open seat, competitive primary | $$$$ |
| **New Hampshire** | OPEN (Jeanne Shaheen retiring) | Open seat | $$$ |
| **Minnesota** | OPEN (Tina Smith retiring) | Open seat | $$$ |
| **Virginia** | Mark Warner | Won by single digits | $$$ |
| **New Jersey** | Cory Booker | Normally safe, could be competitive | $$ |
| **New Mexico** | Ben Ray Luján | Harris won by single digits | $$ |

**Republican-Held Seats Democrats Could Flip:**

| State | Senator | Status | Budget Potential |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Maine** | Susan Collins | Most vulnerable R incumbent | $$$$ |
| **North Carolina** | OPEN (Tillis retiring) | Open seat in purple state | $$$$ |
| **Ohio** | SPECIAL ELECTION (Vance seat) | Sherrod Brown might run again | $$$$ |
| **Texas** | John Cornyn | Competitive + primary drama | $$$ |
| **Alaska** | Dan Sullivan | Close race expected | $$ |
| **Iowa** | Joni Ernst | May not run again | $$ |

**Approach:** Contact campaigns directly — look for the **Campaign Manager** or **Communications Director**. Primary campaigns start hiring vendors NOW.

### 2026 Governor Races — Key Battlegrounds

| State | Incumbent | Situation | Budget |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Georgia** | OPEN (Kemp term-limited) | Top battleground, huge spending | $$$$ |
| **Michigan** | OPEN (Whitmer term-limited) | Top battleground | $$$$ |
| **Arizona** | Katie Hobbs (D) | Reelection, razor-thin margins | $$$$ |
| **Wisconsin** | Tony Evers (D) | GOP target | $$$ |
| **Nevada** | Joe Lombardo (R) | Dem target | $$$ |
| **Kansas** | OPEN (Kelly term-limited) | Open seat | $$$ |
| **Iowa** | OPEN (Reynolds not running?) | Possible open seat | $$$ |
| **New Hampshire** | Kelly Ayotte (R) | Competitive | $$ |
| **Maine** | OPEN (term-limited) | Open seat | $$ |
| **Pennsylvania** | Josh Shapiro (D) | Likely safe but Shapiro raises $$ | $$ |

### 435 House Races

You can't call all 435. Focus on the **50-80 competitive districts** identified by Cook Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, and Inside Elections. These are the ones with real ad budgets.

**Resource:** cookpolitical.com/ratings — their House ratings list shows every "Toss Up" and "Lean" race.

---

## CATEGORY 3: State Party Committees

There are **100 state party committees** (50 D, 50 R). These are UNDERSERVED. They don't have the massive PAC budgets, but they produce their own ads, especially for down-ballot and state legislative races.

**Target the battleground state parties first:**

| State Party | Priority | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| Georgia Democratic Party | ★★★★★ | Senate + Governor, huge spending |
| Michigan Democratic Party | ★★★★★ | Senate + Governor open seats |
| Arizona Democratic Party | ★★★★ | Governor reelection, Senate |
| Wisconsin Democratic Party | ★★★★ | Governor defense |
| North Carolina Democratic Party | ★★★★ | Open Senate seat |
| Pennsylvania Democratic Party | ★★★ | Always competitive |
| Nevada Democratic Party | ★★★ | Governor + Senate proximity |
| Georgia Republican Party | ★★★★ | Governor open, may flip |
| Michigan Republican Party | ★★★★ | Governor open, may flip |
| Ohio Republican Party | ★★★ | Special Senate election |

**How to find contacts:** Each state party has a website. Look for the **Executive Director**, **Political Director**, or **Communications Director**.

---

## CATEGORY 4: Labor Unions

Unions are MASSIVE political ad buyers and most people forget about them. They run their own ad campaigns independent of PACs.

| Union | 2024 Political Spend | Focus |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| **SEIU** | $200M+ program (overall) | Seven-figure ad buys in 9 battleground states. Multi-language. |
| **AFL-CIO** | Seven-figure digital + streaming campaign | Battleground state video featuring union members. |
| **AFSCME** | Major IE spending | State/local elections, public sector issues. |
| **NEA (teachers)** | $30M+ in political spending | Education issues, candidate support. |
| **AFT (teachers)** | $20M+ political | Education issues. Randi Weingarten runs it. |
| **UAW** | Significant political program | Auto workers, manufacturing states. |
| **IBEW** | Major contributor | Infrastructure, energy workers. |
| **Teamsters** | Significant, sometimes bipartisan | Notable for not endorsing in 2024. |
| **UNITE HERE** | Hospitality workers, NV/AZ focused | Battleground state ground game + ads. |

**Why unions are a good target for DSM:**
- They produce their own ads (not through the PAC/agency pipeline)
- They need video featuring real workers (documentary/interview style — you can do this)
- They advertise year-round, not just election season
- Less competition from established political ad firms

---

## CATEGORY 5: Issue Advocacy Organizations (501c4s)

These are NOT PACs. They're nonprofits that run "issue ads" — they can't say "vote for" or "vote against" but they run ads about issues that are effectively political. They spend HEAVILY and they spend YEAR-ROUND.

| Organization | Lean | Focus | Annual Spend |
|-------------|------|-------|-------------|
| Americans for Prosperity (AFP) | R | Free-market, anti-regulation | $100M+ |
| Planned Parenthood Votes | D | Reproductive rights | $50M+ |
| NRA-ILA | R | Gun rights | $30M+ |
| Everytown for Gun Safety | D | Gun control | $40M+ |
| AARP | Bipartisan | Senior issues, Medicare, Social Security | Huge |
| Heritage Action | R | Conservative policy | $20M+ |
| MoveOn.org | D | Progressive activism | $10M+ |
| Americans for Tax Reform | R | Anti-tax | $10M+ |
| Center for American Progress Action | D | Progressive policy | $10M+ |
| League of Conservation Voters | D | Climate/environment | $120M (2024) |
| Majority Forward | D | Schumer-aligned dark money arm | Major |
| One Nation | R | McConnell-aligned dark money arm | Major |

---

## CATEGORY 6: Ballot Measure Campaigns ★★★★

This is a GOLDMINE that most people miss. Ballot measures in 2026 will spend **hundreds of millions** on video.

### Hot 2026 Ballot Measures

| State | Issue | Est. Spending | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Florida** | Marijuana legalization (retry) | $100M+ | Failed at 57% in 2024 (needed 60%). Massive spending battle. |
| **California** | Attorney fee cap (Uber-backed) | $200M+ total | Already doing Super Bowl ads. |
| **Missouri** | Abortion amendment repeal/defense | $50M+ | Both sides spending heavily. |
| **Nevada** | Abortion rights reaffirmation | $20M+ | Must pass twice (passed once in 2024). |
| **Arizona** | Marijuana repeal attempt | $30M+ | Both sides will spend. |
| **Virginia** | Abortion protection amendment | $20M+ | First time on ballot. |
| Multiple states | Cannabis reform (ID, NE, OK, WA) | Varies | Each state = separate campaign. |
| Michigan | Multiple ballot measures | $50M+ combined | Campaign finance, education funding. |

**Why ballot measures are GREAT for a new agency:** Each ballot measure campaign is a NEW organization — they don't have 20-year vendor relationships like the DCCC does. They need to hire production fast, and they hire based on reel quality and availability, not entrenched relationships.

**How to find them:** Ballotpedia.org tracks every ballot measure. Each campaign files with the state Secretary of State — that filing lists the campaign committee, treasurer, and contact info (just like FEC filings).

---

## CATEGORY 7: Lobbying & Public Affairs Firms

DC lobbying firms run "issue campaigns" to influence legislation. They need video for:
- Constituent pressure ads ("Call your Senator")
- Social media campaigns
- Testimony prep / hearing recap videos
- Corporate advocacy campaigns

| Firm | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Brownstein Hyatt | Bipartisan mega-firm |
| Akin Gump | Bipartisan mega-firm |
| BGR Group | Republican-leaning, full comms shop |
| Invariant | Bipartisan, growing |
| Forbes Tate Partners | Bipartisan |
| Precision Strategies | Democrat-leaning (also in agencies list) |
| Subject Matter | Democrat-leaning |
| Xenophon Strategies | PR + crisis, produces "short compelling video" |
| Mercury Public Affairs | Bipartisan |
| Actum | Former Dem operatives |

These firms hire video production on a **project basis** year-round. Not just election season. That's steady income.

---

## CATEGORY 8: Trade Associations & Industry Groups

These groups run DC advocacy ads — often on cable news, digital, and CTV:

| Association | Focus | DC Presence |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **PhRMA** | Big pharma, drug pricing | Massive ad budgets |
| **U.S. Chamber of Commerce** | Business, anti-regulation | Major political spender |
| **American Petroleum Institute** | Oil/gas, energy policy | Major ad campaigns |
| **National Association of Realtors** | Housing, property rights | Top political spender (consistently) |
| **American Hospital Association** | Healthcare | DC advocacy ads |
| **National Association of Manufacturers** | Manufacturing, trade | Issue advocacy |
| **Internet Association / TechNet** | Tech regulation | Growing DC spend |
| **Cryptocurrency industry (Fairshake/Stand With Crypto)** | Crypto regulation | NEW MONEY, $100M+ |
