## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What We Learned

1. **Job postings are just the tip of the iceberg** — most campaigns don't post "video vendor wanted"
2. **Campaigns hire video staff, then those staff hire vendors** — focus on finding the Communications/Digital Directors
3. **Timing matters** — brand new campaigns (Matt Mahan) are BEST targets because they don't have vendor relationships yet
4. **Overflow is the play** — campaigns that already hired one editor will need MORE capacity
5. **Geographic advantage** — DSM has Daryl in Michigan, which has HUGE 2026 races (Senate + Governor open seats)

### The Pitch That Will Work

> "We know 2026 is going to be insane. You just hired [Name] as your video editor, which is great — but one person can't handle a statewide race in a purple state. We've been cutting political spots since '08 (Obama campaign), and we specialize in rapid turnaround 30-second TV ads. We're not trying to replace your in-house team — we just want to be in your rotation when you need overflow capacity or a quick turnaround. Let us show you what we can do."

**Key elements:**
- Acknowledge they already have someone (not competing)
- Position as **overflow/support**, not replacement
- Emphasize **speed** and **experience**
- Offer **proof** (reel, case studies)
- Make it **easy** ("let us show you")

## 🔥 MICHIGAN SENATE RACE — 3-Way Democratic Primary (HUGE OPPORTUNITY)

**Race:** Michigan U.S. Senate (open seat, Gary Peters retiring)  
**Primary:** August 2026

### Why This Is HUGE for DSM

1. **Open seat** = no incumbent advantage = MASSIVE spending
2. **Purple state** = both parties will pour money in

### Michigan Senate Race — DSM Strategy

#### Immediate Actions

1. **Research all three campaigns' staff** — find Communications Directors, Digital Directors
2. **Monitor for video staff hires** — if they post video editor jobs, reach out as vendor
3. **Leverage Daryl's Michigan presence** — local vendor advantage
4. **Pitch all three campaigns** — don't pick sides in primary, offer services to whoever needs it

#### The Pitch

> "We're a political video production shop with roots in Michigan (our videographer Daryl is based in Grand Rapids). We've been cutting spots since the Obama '08 campaign. We know the Michigan Senate race is going to be one of the most expensive in the country, and we specialize in rapid-turnaround 30-second TV ads. Whether you need overflow capacity, rapid response, or just want another vendor in your rotation, we'd love to show you what we can do."

#### Why This Works

- **Local connection** (Daryl) = not just another out-of-state vendor
- **Experience** (Obama '08) = credibility
- **Specialization** (30-second TV ads) = clear value prop
- **Flexibility** ("overflow capacity") = not trying to replace their team
- **No primary politics** = offer services to all three, let them decide

### Michigan Senate Race — Key Intel

**Polling:** Primary is "wide open" according to Emerson College poll (Jan 29, 2026)  
**Fundraising:** All three candidates actively fundraising, no clear frontrunner  
**Timeline:** Primary in August, general election Nov 3  
**Spending:** Expect $50M+ in total spending (both sides, all phases)

**What This Means:**
- **3 campaigns x 6 months to primary** = 18 months of video work potential
- **Winner x 3 months to general** = another 3 months of high-intensity video
- **National PACs** will also spend heavily = more vendor opportunities

---

## 📊 MICHIGAN GOVERNOR RACE — Also Open Seat (Whitmer Term-Limited)

**Race:** Michigan Governor  
**Status:** Gretchen Whitmer term-limited, open seat  
**Competitiveness:** Toss-up to Lean D  
**Primary:** August 2026

### Democratic Candidates (Partial List)

According to search results, there's a "crowded field" but specific names not yet in this article. Need to research further.

**Known Candidates:**
- Mike Duggan (mentioned in related article about fundraising)
- Jocelyn Benson (mentioned in related article)
- Others TBD

**Next Research Task:** Find full list of Michigan Governor candidates and their campaign status

---

## 🎯 MICHIGAN = TOP PRIORITY TARGET

### Why Michigan Should Be DSM's #1 Focus

1. **Two major statewide races** (Senate + Governor) = double the opportunities
2. **Both are open seats** = no incumbents = higher spending
3. **Purple state** = competitive = national money flows in
4. **Daryl is there** = local presence = competitive advantage
5. **Multiple campaigns per race** = lots of targets
6. **Early in cycle** = campaigns still building teams = vendor opportunities

### Michigan Action Plan

**Week 1:**
1. Research all Michigan Senate campaign staff (Stevens, McMorrow, El-Sayed)
2. Research Michigan Governor candidates and their campaigns
3. Find Communications/Digital Directors for each
4. Monitor LinkedIn for Michigan campaign staff hires

**Week 2:**
1. Prepare Michigan-specific pitch deck (emphasize Daryl's local presence)
2. Create Michigan case study (if you have past Michigan work)
3. Reach out to 1-2 campaigns to test pitch
4. Join Michigan political communities (Facebook groups, etc.)

**Week 3:**
1. Follow up with initial contacts
2. Expand outreach to remaining campaigns
3. Attend Michigan political events (if any)
4. Build relationships with Michigan media buyers

---

**BOTTOM LINE:** Michigan is a GOLDMINE. Two open-seat statewide races in a purple state = massive video spending. You have a local presence (Daryl). This should be your #1 geographic focus.
