# Deep State Media — 2026 Research Executive Summary

**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Prepared by:** Manus AI Research Partner  
**For:** Deep State Media (DSM) — Political Video Production Agency

---

## TL;DR — The Opportunity

**2026 is a GOLDMINE for political video work.** We've identified **$200M+ in potential spending** across campaigns and ballot measures that DSM can pursue. The window to get on vendor lists is **NOW through June 2026**.

**Top 5 immediate targets:**
1. Michigan Senate race (3 campaigns, open seat, purple state)
2. Missouri abortion ballot measure ($50M+ fight)
3. Tom Steyer for Governor (billionaire-funded, actively hiring)
4. Nevada abortion ballot measure (swing state, final vote)
5. Virginia abortion ballot measure (swing state, destination state)

---

## What We Found

### 1. Active Campaign Opportunities

**Michigan Senate Race = #1 Priority**
- **3-way Democrat primary:** Haley Stevens, Mallory McMorrow, Abdul El-Sayed
- **Open seat** (Gary Peters retiring) = massive spending
- **Purple state** = competitive = high budgets
- **Daryl is in Michigan** = local vendor advantage
- **Primary in August** = 6 months of intense video work

**Other Hot Campaigns:**
- **Tom Steyer for Governor (CA)** — actively hiring video producer, billionaire-funded
- **Jon Ossoff for Senate (GA)** — just hired video editor, will need overflow
- **Matt Mahan for Governor (CA)** — brand new campaign, no vendor yet

---

### 2. Ballot Measure Campaigns = MASSIVE Opportunity

**Total Spending Estimate:** $100M+ across abortion measures alone

**Confirmed on Ballot:**
- **Missouri Amendment 3** — Defending 2024 pro-choice amendment ($50M+ spending)
- **Nevada Question 6** — Final vote on abortion rights ($15M+ spending)
- **Virginia Reproductive Rights** — Constitutional amendment ($15M+ spending)

**Signature Gathering (May Qualify):**
- **Idaho Reproductive Freedom** — Overturning strict abortion ban ($20M+ if qualifies)
- **Oregon Equality Amendment** — Abortion + LGBTQ+ rights ($5M+)

**Why Ballot Measures Matter:**
- Separate campaigns with their own budgets
- High-emotion messaging = powerful video content
- TV advertising is critical for voter education
- National funding flows to state ballot measures

---

### 3. Media Buying Agencies = The Gatekeepers

**GMMB/Waterfront Strategies** is the 800-pound gorilla:
- **$858M in 2024 spending** (more than double #2)
- Works with Future Forward USA, House Majority PAC, WinSenate PAC
- Connected to Obama, Clinton, Harris campaigns
- **Getting on their vendor list = access to hundreds of millions**

**Other Major Players:**
- Media Buying & Analytics ($339M)
- BPI - Bully Pulpit Interactive ($186M)
- Gambit Strategies ($208M)

**Key Insight:** These agencies don't produce ads themselves — they HIRE production vendors like DSM. They control the budgets, but they need editors to cut the spots.

**Challenge:** GMMB's vendor form is MBE-specific (may not apply to DSM)

**Strategy:** Get clients first (Michigan, ballot measures), then approach agencies with proof of work

---

### 4. The Landscape We Now Understand

**How Political Video Work Flows:**

**Path 1:** PAC → Media Buying Agency (GMMB) → Production Vendor (DSM)  
**Path 2:** Campaign → In-House Video Staff → Overflow Vendor (DSM)  
**Path 3:** Campaign → Direct Hire Production Vendor (DSM)  
**Path 4:** Ballot Measure Campaign → Production Vendor (DSM)

**Key Insight:** Most campaigns don't post "video editor wanted" jobs. They hire a Communications Director or Digital Director, and THAT person hires video vendors. So we need to:
1. Track campaign launches (new campaigns = no vendor relationships yet)
2. Monitor staff hires (new Comms Directors = new vendor opportunities)
3. Reach out to campaigns that JUST hired video staff (they'll need overflow capacity)

---

## Our Recommendations

**Phase 1 (Now - April 2026): Get Clients**
1. Focus on Michigan campaigns (Stevens, McMorrow, El-Sayed)
2. Focus on ballot measure campaigns (Missouri, Nevada, Virginia)

4. Build case studies and testimonials

**Phase 2 (May - July 2026): Build Reputation**
1. Deliver exceptional work on initial projects
2. Get testimonials and referrals
3. Expand to more campaigns

3. Hire additional capacity if needed
4. Build relationships for 2028 cycle

## The Numbers

**Total Market Opportunity:**
- Michigan Senate (3 campaigns): $30M+ combined
- Michigan Governor: $30M+
- Steyer for Governor: $50M+ (self-funded)
- Ossoff for Senate: $40M+
- Missouri ballot measure: $50M+ (both sides)
- Nevada ballot measure: $15M+
- Virginia ballot measure: $15M+
- Idaho ballot measure: $20M+ (if qualifies)
- **TOTAL: $250M+ in identified opportunities**

**DSM's Realistic Target:**
- Capture 1-2% of total spending = $2.5M-$5M in revenue
- At $100k-$200k per client, that's 12-50 clients
- Focus on 5-10 major clients, deliver exceptional work, build reputation

---

## Critical Timing

**NOW (Feb-Mar 2026):** Campaigns are building teams, hiring vendors  
**Apr-May 2026:** Campaigns ramp up, vendor lists finalize  
**Jun-Aug 2026:** Primary season, high-intensity video work  
**Sep-Nov 2026:** General election, peak spending  
**AFTER AUGUST:** Vendor lists lock in, much harder to get new clients

**Bottom Line:** The window to get on vendor lists is **NOW through June**. After August, it's too late for 2026.

## Next Steps

**Decision Point:** Do you want to:

**Option A:** Start outreach immediately (I can help draft emails, find contacts, build pitch decks)

**Option B:** Review the research first, discuss strategy, then begin outreach

**Option C:** Focus on a specific subset (e.g., Michigan only, or ballot measures only)

**My Recommendation:** Start with **Michigan + Missouri ballot measure**. These are the highest-priority, highest-spending opportunities with the best fit for DSM's capabilities.

## Final Thoughts

You've got the experience, the team, and the timing. 2026 is going to be a MASSIVE cycle for political video, and you're positioned to capture a significant share of that work.

The key is to **move fast, deliver quality, and build relationships**. Political video is a relationship business. Get in the door, prove your value, and the referrals will come.
