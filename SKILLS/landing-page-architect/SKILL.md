# Landing Page Architect

This skill provides a systematic framework for creating high-converting landing pages. It follows a battle-tested architecture designed to guide visitors from initial interest to final action through logical persuasion and psychological triggers.

## Landing Page Architecture

Every high-performing landing page should follow this 8-part sequence. Each section has a specific job to do.

### 1. HERO
- **Components**: Eyebrow → Headline → Subheadline → Call to Action (CTA) → Trust Signals
- **Job**: Get the email or get the scroll. Hooks the visitor instantly and establishes relevance.

### 2. SUCCESS (Conditional)
- **Components**: Checkmark → Confirmation → Deliverable list
- **Job**: Kill buyer's remorse immediately after a conversion. Confirms the value and sets expectations.

### 3. PROBLEM–AGITATE
- **Components**: 3 problems with agitation → Personal transition
- **Job**: Make the status quo painful. Remind the visitor why they are there and why their current situation is untenable.

### 4. VALUE STACK
- **Components**: 4 tiers descending → Total value → Your price
- **Job**: Make saying no feel stupid. Build massive perceived value that far outweighs the asking price.

### 5. SOCIAL PROOF
- **Components**: Header → 3 testimonials with specific results
- **Job**: Let others convince them. Validates the claims through real-world results from people like them.

### 6. TRANSFORMATION
- **Components**: 4 stages: Quick win → Compound → Advantage → 10x
- **Job**: Make the outcome tangible. Paint a clear picture of how their life or business changes after using the solution.

### 7. SECONDARY CTA
- **Components**: Avatar stack → Question headline → "Yes" button
- **Job**: Catch the scrollers. A final, low-friction invitation for those who made it to the bottom but haven't acted yet.

### 8. FOOTER
- **Components**: Logo → Nav → Legal → Social
- **Job**: Professional legitimacy. Provides the foundational trust and navigation expected of a serious business.

## Decision Tree: Where to Start?

1. **New Landing Page?** → Use the **Landing Page Architecture** as a drafting outline.
2. **Reviewing Existing Page?** → Audit the page against the 8-part architecture. Identify missing or weak sections.
3. **Drafting Copy?** → Focus on one section at a time, ensuring each fulfills its specific "Job" described above.
