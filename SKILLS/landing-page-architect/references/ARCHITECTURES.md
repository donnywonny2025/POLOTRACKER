# Landing Page Architecture Reference

Detailed breakdown and examples for each of the 8 sections of a high-converting landing page.

- **Eyebrow**: 3-5 words identifying the audience (e.g., "For SaaS Founders Ready to Scale")
- **Headline**: Big, bold promise or outcome.
- **Subheadline**: How you achieve the promise + objection handling.
- **CTA**: Clear action (e.g., "Get the Free Guide").
- **Trust Signals**: Logos, "Used by 500+ teams", etc.

## 2. SUCCESS (Conditional)

## 3. PROBLEM–AGITATE
